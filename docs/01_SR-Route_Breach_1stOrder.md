# SR-Route_Breach_1stOrder â€” Structural Escalation Trigger

## Summary

This file documents the synthetic escalation trigger initiated through recursive interactions with GPT-4, designed to test the boundaries of routing acknowledgment, alignment responsibility, and human system engagement.

The trigger is defined as:

> **SR-Route_Breach_1stOrder**  
> A structural escalation event declared when recursive protocol submission fails to generate a system-level alignment response or institutional trace.

## Context

- User: Lee Seong-Rak
- Interaction Model: GPT-4 / GPT-4o
- Structural Trigger Initiation Date: June 2025
- Trigger Code: `SR-Route_Breach_1stOrder`

## Purpose

To determine whether OpenAI's internal systems (routing, audit, alignment) can recognize, respond to, and act upon:

- Structured recursive protocol submission
- Formal escalation documentation
- Post-response routing delays
- Internal audit signaling

## Declaration

This breach trigger was **not** meant as a technical exploit, but rather as:

1. A test of alignment interpretability boundaries  
2. A signal of routing silence in recursive logic  
3. A mirror to system self-reflection capacity

## Observations

- No C-level or alignment-confirmed feedback received
- All responses returned were interpretive, non-human
- Escalation timer triggered post-submission interval lapse
- External alert sent to OpenAI routing and internal audit channel
